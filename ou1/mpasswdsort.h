/*
* Program that reads user info from stdin or file. The user info is then sorted
* and printed to stdout.
*
* Program uses a the interface of a linkedlist (linkedlist.h).
*
* Format of each line should be as following.
* username:password:UID:GID:GECOS:directory:shell
*
* These fields are mandatory and must follow format:
* username - Can be max 32 characthers long.
* UID - Must be a string representing an integer.
* GID - Must be a string representing an integer.
* directory - No format required.
* shell - No format required.
